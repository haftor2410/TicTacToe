Amazing TicTacToe game!
This is the travis build status for the travisSetUp branch:
![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/7kings/TicTacToe.svg?branch=master "Travis status")


Description:

Each team should implement the game TicTacToe. The main focus is on the
infrastructure and best coding practices described below but not on
implemented features.
The project and infrastructure should tackle the following:
1. The code base is stored in source control system on GitHub from early
start of the project (the teacher should be able to track the history of the
project from the creation of the very first file).
2. The system is setup with automatic build that must run all unit tests.
3. The output is a deployable or executable artifact, such as a jar/war or
equivalent.
4. The build script has deploy/install target that deploys the executable
outside of the working directory or on external server.
5. The business logic should be coded using Test Driven Development.
6. The code should be loosely coupled and follow good object oriented
design practices.
7. It is possible to get extra points for the following
1. More build targets (0,5 point per item, never more than 1 for this
part)
Code coverages
Code inspection
Integrate database
2. Run focused integration or End-to-end tests (e.g. Selenium). It is
